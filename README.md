My personal site, with all of my projects on it. UPDATE FEBRUARY 4, 2017: Finally finished moving all of my files from Google Drive to here since the Drive hosting service is now defunct. I left behind a few image files I'll probably never use, but uploaded the rest of my old half-coded, defunct projects in the 'abandoned' folder for preservation purposes or in case I want to return to them later. All the other files in the main directory are either files actively being used by my site, or files I'm currently coding.
