# chromeoverload.github.io
My personal site, with all of my projects on it. I'm currently in the process of moving from Google Drive hosting to here. Sorry about the lack of organization, once everything here is finished I'll get on that. Right now, all of these files are the exact files from my Drive site. Before this site is ready, the files must be changed slightly to match the new Github hosting service.
