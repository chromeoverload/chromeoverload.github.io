    Welcome to my personal expirements site! This site and all of its contents has been coded from scratch in HTML and CSS by me, Jared, and are hosted using a nifty Google Drive trick. Click on the projects tab above to check out the things I've made, visit my Blog to keep track of my projects as I develop them, or keep reading to learn a little bit more about me!

    <h3 class="subheader">|About Me|</h3>
    <p class="outtext">
        My name is Jared (sometimes known online as Tareton Thorndike), and I am a Dallas high school student with way too much
      	free time. Besides HTMl coding, my other main interests are acting and 
      	indie games. I have even dabbled in PC game development myself, though 
      	most of my projects never came to fruition. Before this site, I used weebly 
      	to create a site where I reviewed indie games at 
      	<a href="http://indierun.co.nr">indierun.co.nr</a>, but I stopped posting after
      	a while. After that, I figured I'd base all my future projects on this site.
      	I don't really have a schedule of when I do things, I just sort of code whenever
      	 I have spare time. I hope do learn the wonderful art of creating Twitter bots soon. Stay tuned! Tweet me <a href="http://twitter.com/chromeoverload">@chromeoverload</a>.
