    Welcome to my personal expirements site! This site and all of its contents has been coded from scratch in HTML and CSS by 
    me, Jared, and are hosted using Github. Click on the projects tab above to check out the things I've made, visit my Blog 
    to keep track of my projects as I develop them, or keep reading to learn a little bit more about me!

    <h3 class="subheader">About Me</h3>
    <p class="outtext">
        My name is Jared (sometimes known online as Tareton Thorndike), and I am a Dallas high school student with way too much
      	free time. Besides HTMl coding, my other main interests are acting and 
      	indie games. I have even dabbled in PC game development myself, though 
      	most of my projects never came to fruition. Before this site, I used weebly 
      	to create a site where I reviewed indie games at 
      	<a href="http://indierun.co.nr">indierun.co.nr</a>, but I stopped posting after
      	a while. After that, I figured I'd base all my future projects on this site.
      	I don't really have a schedule of when I do things, I just sort of code whenever
      	 I have spare time. I hope to learn the wonderful art of creating Twitter bots soon. 
	    Tweet me <a href="http://twitter.com/chromeoverload">@chromeoverload</a>, send me 
	    business inquiries at <a href="mailto:chromeoverload@gmail.com">chromeoverload@gmail.com</a>, 
	    and follow me at <a href="https://chromeoverload.itch.io/">Itch.io</a>. I also have a 
	    <a href="http://beepsandbeats.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a> and a <a href="https://soundcloud.com/beeps-beats">Soundcloud</a> 
	    that I post to about art and music sometimes. Stay tuned!
