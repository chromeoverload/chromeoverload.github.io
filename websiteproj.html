        This site was coded completely from scratch. When I initially started, I knew that 
        I wanted to be able to edit it from any device, have it sync automatically with cloud 
        storage, and not have to pay any money to do either. For my storage method, I originally chose 
        Google Drive (as I am a heavy Google user). Next, I needed a method to host websites on 
        Google Drive. Turns out that a man named Amit Agarwal wrote a niftly little Google 
        Script (tutorial <a href="http://www.labnol.org/internet/host-website-on-google-drive/28178/">here</a>) 
        that did just that. The script has you upload a zip file containing the webpage 
        files, and then creates a public folder in your Drive containing those files. It 
        then generates a web link using the folder name, and gives that link to you. I had 
        already used the free subdomain redirection service co.nr, so I linked chromeoverload.co.nr 
        to the Google Drive website link.
	<br>
	<br>
	However, a few years later I noticed that the Google Drive hosting trick had become defunct, and the links no longer worked. Thus, I decided to move everything to Github and edit it all online from Github itself. Thus, the site in its current iteration was created.

      <h3 class="subheader">|How I Edit This Site|</h3>
      <p class="outtext">
        To edit this site, I had originally wanted to use a cross-platform IDE that I could load from 
        any device. As a Google user, I looked toward Chrome-based IDEs, specifically ones 
        on the Chrome Web Store. I chose the IDE <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/puresolid-ide/ndhdjddnbbjnojdjbglbpenimlpnlpbl?hl=en-US">Puresolid IDE</a> 
        because it had the best autcomplete, text highlighting, and overall interface. I can install this 
        Chrome App on any computer. But, as a backup, I wanted a browser-based editor that I 
        could use from even my mobile devices. I found 
        <a href="http://editey.com/">Editey</a>, a Drive App/browser based editor that 
        runs fairly smoothly on my iPad. And with that, I was set!
	<br>
	<br>
	However, since Github has its own built-in online IDE/coding interface, I just everything there now.
